Overview of Module 9.
Module 9 in data set queries started with SQLite. it has been said that this can be run on iPhone. 
I will have to see that for in the boot camp - we have not built an app for thsi operation. 
the focus in mod 9 is to query ans save the date in local data frames.this worked well , however trying to get FLASK operation 
is the main challenge for Mod 9.
	The SQL query is saved in VSC for Mod 7. 
	Curiously in Mod 9 we used JB and save locally. 
	VSCode was used to for flask.

---Project Overview of the analysis
	Exploring the weather map was interesting for the challenge - by removing the precipitation from the decision making process.
	The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. 
	When cooled further, the airborne water vapor will condense to form liquid water (dew). 
	When air cools to its dew point through contact with a surface that is colder than the air, 
	water will condense on the surface. dew point, percipitation and temperature is important information when considering a waves and ice cream venture.
	one peice of this information - temperature only - is working with biased data.

---Results. 
results list looking at June and December temperature data is the deliverable.
seven years of empirical date from hawaii.sqlite is queried and save into data frames.th results are plotted as temperature reference. 
the data should be overlaid with more data to make this and effective communication tool.
result over view:

June average temperature is 74F

December average temperature is 71.F

---unsolicted recommendation:
	get the rest of the data
